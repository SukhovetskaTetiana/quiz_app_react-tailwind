# QUIZ Application #####(React+Tailwind)

This project is an interactive quiz created using React and Tailwind. Its main goal is to allow users to take the quiz, answer questions, and receive feedback on the correctness of their answers. At the end of the quiz, users receive a summary of their responses, which helps them evaluate their knowledge and skills.

The components _Question_ and _Summary_ are responsible for displaying questions and summarizing responses, respectively.

The main component _Quis_ coordinates the functionality of other components. It manages user responses and determines when the quiz is completed.

The _QuestionsTimer_ component adds a time element to each question to encourage users to respond more quickly. It utilizes useEffect to manage timers and update remaining time, enhancing the quiz's dynamic and interactive nature.

The _Answers_ component displays answer options and allows users to select their choices, updating the state using useState.

Overall, the project includes various aspects such as state management, timer handling, and event processing to create an engaging quiz experience.
